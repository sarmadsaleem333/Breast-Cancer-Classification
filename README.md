## Overview

The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign based on features such as tumor size, texture, and other characteristics provided in the dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The scikit-learn breast cancer dataset is a preloaded dataset included with scikit-learn. It contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells, with 30 features per sample. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**: Explore the dataset, handle missing values (if any), and perform feature scaling or normalization.
   
2. **Train the models**: Implement and train various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, etc., on the dataset.

3. **Evaluate the models**: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Compare the performance of different models to select the best one for your classification task.
